### Overview

`manifold` is a general-purpose highlighting engine for highlighting common objects such as dates, numbers, keywords,
and UUIDs. It works by surrounding these items with ANSI color codes, enabling them to be displayed in color in the
terminal.

If you're just interested in a cli for highlighting text, see [`tailspin`](https://github.com/bensadeh/tailspin).

- Keywords
- Numbers
